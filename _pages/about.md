Hi! I'm Khanh Nguyen, a third-year PhD student at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es), [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat) (UAB), advised by Prof. [Dimosthenis Karatzas](https://www.karatzas.co.uk/people/dimosthenis-karatzas). My research lies on the intersection of Trustworthy AI and Large Vision–Language Models, with a focus on Privacy and Safety. I’m currently working on Document Intelligence usecase as part of the [European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI (ELSA)](https://elsa-ai.eu) project.

I hold an MSc in Computer Vision from UAB, where I completed my Master’s thesis at the [Vision, Language and Reading](https://www.karatzas.co.uk) (VLR) group, advised by Dr. [Ali Furkan Biten](https://github.com/furkanbiten) and Dr. [Andres Mafla](https://es.linkedin.com/in/andres-mafla-delgado-a17bb981).

Previously, I received a B.Eng. in Electronics and Telecommunications from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://hust.edu.vn). During my final years there, I worked as a research assistant [Embedded Networking Laboratory](https://www.facebook.com/lab411) with Dr. [Pham Van Tien](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=8RuTs_kAAAAJ), focusing on wireless sensor networks for IoT systems.

Before graduate studies, I spent two years as a data engineer at [Saltlux Inc.](https://saltlux.vn), developing distributed systems for large-scale data collection and processing.
